# Kick-it (frontend) 

## About
Have you ever tried to organize an event between friends and family only for seemingly every suggested day and time to be shot down at the last moment? 

Kick-it is a webapp designed to take the hastle out of organizing small events. Create events, propose days and times, and invite your friends and family to submit their own availabilities. Results are conveyed in a visual format so identifying the day and time that works best is easy. You can even dig into the details and view the availability of any one individual, ensuring no one is left out without a good reason!
